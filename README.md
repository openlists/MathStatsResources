# Math and Statistics Learning and Reference Resources

This is a collection of open courses and learning resources for topics in mathematics and statistics that are highly relevant to cognitive science. 

## Linear Algebra

MIT OpenCourseWare is the best! Gilbert Strang's introductory Linear Algebra Class is available for free online, as is a newer course on Linear Alebra's applications in data analysis and machine learning. The courses include lecture videos, selected readings from Strang's books, and problem sets.

## Probability
Harvard's Joe Blitzstein has made his textbook, course syllabus, practice problems (with solutions!), and **awesome lectures** openly available to the public.

## Statistical Inference and Bayesian Approaches
Richard McElreath's *Statistical Rethinking* is an awesome resource, particularly for scientists with moderate background in univariate statistics and inference who are looking to take the next step. He is a fantastic teacher and his target audience is scientists who are eager to get better at statistics and modelling. McElreath teaches a Bayesian approach to statistical inference, so this is a great entry point for those looking to get into Bayesian data analysis. While the full textbook itself is not free, there's a wealth of free online resources,
including a full set of lecture videos and slides with problem sets and code examples in R (plus conversions to Python and Julia).

## Statistical Learning
It's hard to beat the freely available textbook *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* if you want a good primer on machine learning methods (and intuition!). It's one of the most popular textbooks for teaching statistics in formal university settings as well, and has well-developed examples in R with publicly available datasets. The more recent second edition (2021) adds modern topics like Deep Learning and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees.
