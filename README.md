# Math & Statistics Resources

This is a collection of open courses and learning resources for topics in mathematics and statistics.

In terms of scope, this collection includes topics across mathematics and statistics, up to and including topics in machine learning and data analysis. However, it does not cover deep learning, for which there are other available resource lists.

#### Statistical Rethinking

'Statistical Rethinking', by Richard McElreath is a great resource for scientists with moderate background in univariate statistics and inference who want to learn more about statistics and modelling, with a focus on a Bayesian approach to statistical inference.

While the full textbook itself is not free, there's a wealth of free online resources, including a full set of lecture videos and slides with problem sets and code examples in R (plus conversions to Python and Julia).

#### An Introduction to Statistical Learning

The freely available textbook *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* provides a primer on machine learning methods (and intuition!). It's one of the most popular textbooks for teaching statistics in formal university settings as well, and has well-developed examples in R with publicly available datasets. The more recent second edition (2021) adds modern topics like Deep Learning and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees.
